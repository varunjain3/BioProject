2 sequences for DGCR5 (NR_026651.1, NR_024159.1) without any mentioning of transcript variants, while 3 sequences of DGCR5 with clear mentioning of transcipt variants.

PREDICTED REFSEQ (NR_026651.1): This record has not been reviewed and the function is unknown. The reference sequence was derived from BU584104.1, AC000095.5, L77559.1 and BM681417.1.

All transcriprt variants of DGCR5 (NR_002733.2, NR_045121.1, NR_110533.1, NR_026651.1 and NR_024159.1) are reported (Gene Cards - GCID: GC22P019556)

PQS 2 obtained in DGCR5_Variant 2 (NR_045121.1) when search parameter was set to Min G-Group Size: 2 was replaced by another PQS of same score (by shifting G-Group/Quartet frame) when search parameter was set to Min G-Group Size: 3. Rest two PQS were same in both search parameters.
For further consideration, PQS when search parameter was set to Min G-Group Size: 3 was taken.","3 (DGCR5)
